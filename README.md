(this is the SINATRA version of Every Kind of Odds)

EVERY KIND OF ODDS
======
## OVERVIEW

My goal for this project is to refamiliarize myself with the various frameworks I learned in school as well as some I'm starting to investigate on my own. I hope by keeping the same basic application structure & function I can really get a deeper understanding of the nuances of each type of framework.

## THE RULES OF ODDS

Odds is a ridiculous form of daring/betting game that was introduced to me by my friends and frequent collaborators, [Edward Gemson](https://github.com/EdwardGemson) and [Scott Chou](https://github.com/scottychou). Basically, it's a way to dare your friends to do humorous or embarassing stunts.

There's a couple of forms the game can take but the one I was taught is as follows...

1. The Challenger (CR) issues the dare in the following form:

"What are the odds that you (ridiculous thing)?" (Frequently shortened as "Odds that you...?")

2. The Challenged (CD) states an integer number greater than 1 that indicates the odds of them attempting this stunt are are 1 in (that number): 

"The odds are 1 in (X)" or simply ("X")

3. The CR and the CD both silently select an integer between 1 and the chosen number, inclusive.

4. The CR and the CD both count down (vocally and in unison) "Three, two, one..." and then state the number they chose.

5. If the numbers match, the CD must complete the stunt.

**BUT!**

- If the CD selects 2 as the initial odds (ie, the odds are 1 in 2), then the CR and the CD must both think of either the integer 1 or 2. If after they count down and the CR has guessed the CD's number, then the CD attempts the stunt as usual. HOWEVER if the numbers don't match, then the CR themselves must attempt the stunt. This adds an element of risk to challenging your friends to the odds!

- Negotiation of the CD's initially given odds is encouraged.

- Certain daring CDs will select 1 as the initial odds (ie, the odds are 1 in 1) and then immediately complete the stunt.

If you are willing to do some deep internet sleuthing, there is in fact a video of me losing a 1 in 14 odds and having to offer strangers on the subway some of my giant salad. But I ask you not to do this.


## AN ODDS APP
### MVP
Here's what I think an Odds app mvp should have:

1. Users should be able to register
2. Users should be able to find other users, and add them to a list of friends/odds buddies
3. Users should be able to challenge each other to games of odds
  * The CD should be able to set the odds or refuse the challenge
  * The CR should be able to accept or refuse (at least once) those odds
  * They should be able to both guess and have the app tell them who, if either of them, has to complete the odds
  * The CD should be able to let the CR know when the odds have been completed, and send them a text description of how it went
4. Users should be able to see a list of challenged, recieved, and completed odds


### Additional Features??
+ Submitting photo or video proof of odds completion
+ Leaderboards
+ Disposable/1-time "accounts" to participate in a single Odds
